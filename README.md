# CPP Exercises

I am using this repository to get familiar with the github workflow to track and manage files that contain exercises from the course "Learn C++ Programming -Beginner to Advance- Deep Dive in C++" by Abdul Bari.

On a different directory I am storing the exercises from the book "PROGRAMMING - Principles and Practice Using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup.
