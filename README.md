# CPP Exercises

I am using this repository to get familiar with the github workflow to track and manage files.  

The repository contains two directories: "DeepDiveCPP" and "PPP-CPP". The first directory stores the exercises I completed while taking the course "Learn C++ Programming -Beginner to Advance- Deep Dive in C++" by Abdul Bari. And the second one stores exercises from the book "PROGRAMMING - Principles and Practice Using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup.
